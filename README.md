I am a horrible test taker due to my test anxiety. I love things people think are weird like taking walks alone, spending time with myself and exploring new ways to interact with different groups of people.
My anxiety gets to me alot, but I am a man-made girl striving on my own, of course with the help of my peers. 


People judge me alot, and I hate it. I know how to control myself within my surroundings,
but some don't and it's totally fine. That's why I cope with their 
and try to help them if they need it. I may not be great in every aspect in life, including school, but I try to find ways to cope with it knowing my limitations.


Yup well that is me, Donia Abdelhalim! 

Hope you enjoyed my all about me.
